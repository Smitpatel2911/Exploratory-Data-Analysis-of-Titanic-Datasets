# 🚢 Titanic Survival EDA — First Data Science Project

Welcome to my first Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project using the classic **Titanic survival dataset**. This dataset is a great starting point for beginners to understand data patterns, clean real-world data, and build data storytelling skills.

## 🔍 Objective
To explore survival patterns based on features like **gender, class, age, family size, fare**, and more using Python libraries.

## 📂 Project Structure
- `titanic.csv`: Dataset (from Kaggle)
- `Titanic_EDA.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with full analysis
- `video_walkthrough.mp4`: Short video explaining the process (optional)
- `README.md`: Project overview

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 💡 Key Insights
- 🎟️ Passengers in **1st class** had a higher survival rate than those in 3rd class.
- 🚺 Women were more likely to survive, especially in higher classes.
- 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Family size impacted survival — small families did better.
- ⚓ Embarkation point also showed patterns worth noting.

---

## 🎯 Skills Practiced
- Data cleaning & preprocessing
- Handling missing values
- Univariate and bivariate analysis
- Visual storytelling
